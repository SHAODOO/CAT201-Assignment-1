TUTORIAL: S03 
 
Q1: What is the relationship between STUDENT, COURSE and STUDENT_COURSE tables? Explain. 
One student can take many courses. 
One course can taken by many students. 
Therefore, it is many to many relationship. 
STUDENT_COURSE is bridge entity between STUDENT and COURSE. 
 
2: Do the following two CREATE TABLE statements in A and B produce the same output in terms of  
primary key creation? Yes or no? 
Yes. A will come with constrain name that we defined but B come with random name. 
 
Q3: What is a .csv file? Explain it by giving an example. 
.csv file stands for comma-seperate values is a text file that store a list of data. 
For example, STUDENT.csv contains row (record) and column (attribute). 
 
Q4: Are you able to execute the above statement successfully? Highlight the error if you encounter  
any. Provide reason why the error occurs and fix the error. Please include your discussion in the 
lab report. 
No. It shows SQL Error: ORA-00947: not enough values 
00947. 00000 -  "not enough values". It less one attribute which is SCORE.  
I include the SCORE in the parameters. 
After I run the command again it still occurs error ORA-02291: integrity constraint 
(SYSTEM.SC_COURSE_CODE_FK) violated - parent key not found 
The parent key (CMM222) doesn't exist in COURSE table. I can add it to the parent table. 
 
Q5: Are you able to execute the above statement successfully? Highlight the error if you encounter  
any. Provide reason why the error occurs and fix the error. Please include your discussion in the 
lab report. 
No. It shows ORA-00001: unique constraint (SYSTEM.STUDENT_PK) violated because 11128 already 
exist in the table. 
We can change with another unique primary key in order to insert to the table. 
 
Q6: Provide a SQL command which allows us to locate a student with STUDENT_ID = 11126. What 
is  
the student’s name? The SQL command must be included in the lab report. 
SELECT STUDENT_NAME, STUDENT_ID FROM STUDENT WHERE STUDENT_ID = 11126 ; 
 
Q7: Examine the output of the following SQL statement: 
SELECT *  
FROM STUDENT 
WHERE STUDENT_PHONE LIKE '%5_1%'; 
Explain what the SQL statement does based on the output in your lab report. 
It will sorts and displays row(s) that contain with one character between 5 and 1. 
 
Q8: Write a SELECT statement using aggregate function to return the number of students in the  
STUDENT table. 
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM STUDENT;
